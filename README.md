GTU-Student-Attendance-System
=============================

An online student attendance management system for recording the student attendance over the web and generating various reports from it. Intended and designed considering the operation of GTU (Gujarat Technological University) it can be used by other Institutions as well if it fits their needs (feel free to suggest changes). We always aim to make this more and more flexible so that it can be used by any Institution. Developed by two students of SAL Institute of Techonology &amp; Engineering Research as part of their final year academic project (2013-2014) which falls under GTU.
